Aminoacids need lower pH for preservation. If HCl- is used to achieve this, it leads to acidosis, because HCl- remains in the circulation, while the aminoacids are metabolized or incorporated into proteins. 

Newer solutions include acetic acid instead of HCl-, meaning that it is also metabolized. However, we are still adding acid to the body, possibly causing non-anion gap metabolic acidosis.
