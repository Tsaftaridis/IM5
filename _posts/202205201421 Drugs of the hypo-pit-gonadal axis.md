Hypothalamus - Pituitary - Gonad - Peripheral tissue 

GnRH - LH, FSH - Testosterone/Estrogen - DHT

GnRH receptors - LH, FSH receptors - Androgen receptors/Estrogen receptors 

Clomiphene, oral contraceptives - GnRH agonists/antagonists (goserelin, leuprolide)- Spironolactone, Ketoconazole, Danazol, Anastrozole, Letrozole, Exemestane  - Finasteride, SERMs (raloxifene, tamoxifen), spironolactone, flutamide, cyproterone

__List__ 
* Clomiphene 
	* Estrogen receptor antagonist in hypothalamus. Used in PCOS (oligoovulation/anovulation). 
* Goserelin
	* GnRH agonist. Used in prostate cancer, precocious puberty, menorrhagia, endometriosis [steady dose], infertility treatment [pulsatile]. 
* Leuprolide 
	* GnRH receptor agonist/GnRH analog used to stop hypthalamic GnRH secretion. Same as above: prostate cancer, menorrhagia, precocious puberty, endometriosis [Steady],Infertility treatment [pulsatile]
* Danazol 
	* Androgen agonist  acting on the pituitary - lowers LH, FSH from the pituitary. Used for leiomyomas, endometriosis, fibrocystic breast disease, hereditary angioedema, ITP. 
* Anastrozole 
	* Aromatase inhibitor used for hormone receptor positive breast cancer (stops conversion from androgens to estrogens)
* Exemestane 
	* Aromatase inhibitor - hormone-receptor positive BRCA 
* Finasteride 
	* BPHH, alopecia, hirsutism in PCOS 
* Raloxifene 
	* Stops growth of breast and endometrium, protects bones. Used for osteoporosis, contraindications to bisphosphonates, in postmenopausal women who need BRCA prophylaxis. 
* Tamoxifen 
	* Antiestrogenic effects on the breast and estrogenic effects on the uterus and bone. 
* Flutamide 
	* Androgen receptor blocker. Used for metastatic prostate cancer. 
* Cyproterone 
	* Inhibits the binding of DHT and inhibits LH secretion - used for prostate cancer, hypersexuality, precocious puberty, hirsutism. 
* Spironolactone 
	* Potassium-sparing diuretic - acts on the aldosterone receptor - blocks it - stops K+ from being excreted in exchange for Na+. Also has endocrine side-effects (hormonal effects). Eplerenone has fewer such effects.
* Ketoconazole 
	* Antifungal, stops cortisol synthesis, used to treat Cushing syndrome.  
* Letrozole 
	* Aromatase inhibitor used in hormone receptor positive breast cancer and anovulatory cycles (PCOS) - induces ovulation (reduces estrogens - leads to increased FSH and ovulation)
